"""
Structure for implementing LinearSVC, with all the arguments as attributes to
this structure. The *'clf'* attribute is the python object of LinearSVC that is
constructed by the constructor function of this structure as soon as a LinearSVM
instance is created by the user.

The available specifications for creating a model of LinearSVM are :

- penalty:: String
- loss :: String
- dual :: Bool
- tol :: Float64
- C :: Float64
- multi_class :: String
- fit_intercept :: Bool
- intercept_scaling :: Float64
- class_weight :: Dict
- verbose :: Int64
- random_state :: Int
- max_iter :: Int64

One should refer to the ScikitLearn documentation of LinearSVC whose link
is provided above for the better understanding of these parameters with respect
to Linear Support Vector Machine.

    ## Example
    using RiemannianML
    model = LinearSVM()
