This is a structure of the MDM model. It has two attributes namely metric and
class_means.
- **metric :: Metric**        :- The user needs to specify the metric space in which all the distance
  computations is to be done. The possible options are:

| Metric   | Mean estimation |
|:---------- |:----------- |
| Euclidean  | distance: Œ¥_e; mean: Arithmetic |
| invEuclidean | distance: Œ¥_i; mean: Harmonic |
| ChoEuclidean | distance: Œ¥_c; mean: Cholesky Euclidean |
| logEuclidean | distance: Œ¥_l; mean: Log Euclidean |
| logCholesky  | distance: Œ¥_c; mean: Log-Cholesky |
| Fisher       | distance: Œ¥_f; mean: Fisher (Cartan, Karcher, Pusz-Woronowicz,...) |
| logdet0      | distance: Œ¥_s; mean: LogDet (S, Œ±, Bhattacharyya, Jensen,...) |
| Jeffrey      | distance: Œ¥_j; mean: Jeffrey (symmetrized Kullback-Leibler) |
| VonNeumann   | distance: Œ¥_v; mean: Not Availale |
| Wasserstein  |   distance: Œ¥_w; mean: Wasserstein (Bures, Hellinger, ...) |

- **class_means**             :- This is not to be specified by the user. This comes to play when
                                a model is fit with a set of training data so we have to store the means corresponding
                                to each of the classes. We can directly access this for an already fit model
                                while using functions like predict.

This function is kind of an interface to the mean function of PostDefManifold
for computing means for mdm classifier whith metrics other than Fisher, logdet0
and Wasserstein. For these three types of metrics specially it is an interface to
their respective mean functions in PostDefManifold. Since the above three metrics
do not have any closed form solution for estimating the mean, hence we follow
iterative algorithms to compensate for that. As iterative algorithms are
always accompanied by the question of convergence, so, in order to answer
that we need a convergence check for these three metric types which is
facilitated by their respective mean functions. Thereby calling them instead
of the generalised mean function specifically for these three kinds of metric.
