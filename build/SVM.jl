# An object of scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier is automatically created by the constructor
# as soon as an object of this struct is created by the user. This structure is created to
# that the same fit! function from ScikitLearn.jl could be used. To overwrite fit! with the
# same number of sttributes and similar type we needed to make a change in the argument types,
# but the sample labels could not differ and the training samples are not of any specified
# type in ScikitLearn.jl. This gives rise to ambiguities. So, the only option was to change the
# model type. Now our fit!(the one we have written) takes a julia structure, training samples
# and labels y. This difference solves the ambiguity between the two available fit! options.

This module implements the Support Vector models for the data points in the manifold
    of positive definite matrices. The structures below are similar to classes of
    LinearSVC and SVC we have in ScikitLearn in Python. The user has to create an
    object/instance for the classifier class(here structure). The user can create a
    model instance of all the desired specifications.The specifications are added
    as atributes to these structures. This Module incorporates two models of
    Support Vector Machine type :
    1) LinearSVM
    2) SVM

    For further information on LinearSVM and SVM one may refer to the scikit-learn
    documentations of [LinearSVC]
    (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html) and
    [SVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)
    respectively.
