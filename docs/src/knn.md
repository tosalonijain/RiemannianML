This unit implements the **KNeighborsClassifier** model for the data points in the Riemannian manifold of *Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)*. The structure below is similar to a class of
KNeighborsClassifier we have in ScikitLearn in Python. For further information on kneighborClf,
one may refer to the scikit-learn documentation of [KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html).

An object of scikit-learn **KNeighborsClassifier** is automatically created by the constructor
as soon as an object of this struct is created by the user.
